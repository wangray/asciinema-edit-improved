# asciinema-edit-improved
Simple python script for asciinema editing, supports five commands, easily hackable

* `keep` - keeps one range of cast
* `excise` - removes certain ranges of cast
* `quantize` - reduces the maximum gap between events
* `speed` - modifies speed of certain ranges
* `smush` - 
        Compresses beginning of cast 
        (useful for TUI apps where you want to start in the middle of a cast without losing TUI elements loaded at the beginning)
